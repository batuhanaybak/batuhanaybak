Hello Hobsons team,

1- After cloning the project, you shouldn't need anything but Chrome installed.
2- I used directConnect way, so no worries on the Selenium set up.
3- In order to run, go to Terminal and navigate to the Configuration folder and type "protractor conf.js". Then, hit enter.
4- That should do it, but I am still going to include a link for Screen Castify from my end in case if your end would have an issue while running.
